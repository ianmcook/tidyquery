**tidyquery** runs SQL queries on R data frames.

It uses [queryparser](https://github.com/ianmcook/queryparser) to translate SQL queries into R expressions, then it uses [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org) to evaluate these expressions and return results. **tidyquery** does not load data frames into a database; it queries them in place.

For an introduction to **tidyquery** and **queryparser**, watch the recording of the talk ["Bridging the Gap between SQL and R"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwP5KdWSgqE) from rstudio::conf(2020).

## Installation

Install the released version of **tidyquery** from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tidyquery) with:

``` r
install.packages("tidyquery")
```

Or install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/ianmcook/tidyquery) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ianmcook/tidyquery")
```

## Usage

**tidyquery** exports two functions: `query()` and `show_dplyr()`.

### Using `query()`

To run a SQL query on an R data frame, call the function `query()`, passing a `SELECT` statement enclosed in quotes as the first argument. The table names in the `FROM` clause should match the names of data frames in your current R session:

```{r}
library(tidyquery)
library(nycflights13)

query(
" SELECT origin, dest,
    COUNT(flight) AS num_flts,
    round(SUM(seats)) AS num_seats,
    round(AVG(arr_delay)) AS avg_delay
  FROM flights f LEFT OUTER JOIN planes p
    ON f.tailnum = p.tailnum
  WHERE distance BETWEEN 200 AND 300
    AND air_time IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY origin, dest
  HAVING num_flts > 3000
  ORDER BY num_seats DESC, avg_delay ASC
  LIMIT 2;"
)
```

Alternatively, for single-table queries, you can pass a data frame as the first argument and a `SELECT` statement as the second argument, omitting the `FROM` clause. This allows `query()` to function like a dplyr verb:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

airports %>%
  query("SELECT name, lat, lon ORDER BY lat DESC LIMIT 5")
```

You can chain dplyr verbs before and after `query()`:

```{r}
planes %>%
  filter(engine == "Turbo-fan") %>%
  query("SELECT manufacturer AS maker, COUNT(*) AS num_planes GROUP BY maker") %>%
  arrange(desc(num_planes)) %>%
  head(5)
```

In the `SELECT` statement, the names of data frames and columns are case-sensitive (like in R) but keywords and function names are case-insensitive (like in SQL).

In addition to R data frames and tibbles (`tbl_df` objects), `query()` can be used to query other data frame-like objects, including:

- `dtplyr_step` objects created with [dtplyr](https://dtplyr.tidyverse.org), a [data.table](https://r-datatable.com/) backend for dplyr 
- `tbl_sql` objects created with [dbplyr](https://dbplyr.tidyverse.org) or a dbplyr backend package, enabling you to write SQL which is translated to dplyr then translated back to SQL and run in a database (a fun party trick!)
- Apache Arrow `Table`, `RecordBatch`, `Dataset`, and `arrow_dplyr_query` objects created with [arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/)

### Using `show_dplyr()`

**tidyquery** works by generating dplyr code. To print the dplyr code instead of running it, use `show_dplyr()`:

```{r}
show_dplyr(
" SELECT manufacturer, 
    COUNT(*) AS num_planes
  FROM planes
  WHERE engine = 'Turbo-fan'
  GROUP BY manufacturer
  ORDER BY num_planes DESC;"
)
```


## Current Limitations

**tidyquery** is subject to the current limitations of the queryparser package. Please see the **Current Limitations** section of the queryparser README on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=queryparser/readme/README.html#current-limitations) or [GitHub](https://github.com/ianmcook/queryparser#current-limitations).

**tidyquery** also has the following additional limitations:

- Joins involving three or more tables are not supported.
- Because joins in dplyr currently work in a fundamentally different way than joins in SQL, some other types of join queries are not supported. Examples of unsupported join queries include non-equijoin queries and outer join queries with qualified references to the join column(s). Planned changes in dplyr will enable future versions of tidyquery to support more types of joins.


## Related Work

The **sqldf** package ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sqldf), [GitHub](https://github.com/ggrothendieck/sqldf)) runs SQL queries on R data frames by transparently setting up a database, loading data from R data frames into the database, running SQL queries in the database, and returning results as R data frames.

The **duckdb** package ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=duckdb), [GitHub](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/tree/master/tools/rpkg)) includes the function `duckdb_register()` which registers an R data frame as a virtual table in a [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org) database, enabling you to run SQL queries on the data frame with `DBI::dbGetQuery()`.

The **[dbplyr](https://dbplyr.tidyverse.org)** package ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dbplyr), [GitHub](https://github.com/tidyverse/dbplyr)) is like tidyquery in reverse: it converts dplyr code into SQL, allowing you to use dplyr to work with data in a database.

In **Python**, the
 [**dataframe_sql**](https://github.com/zbrookle/dataframe_sql)
 package (targeting [**pandas**](https://pandas.pydata.org)) and the
 [**sql_to_ibis**](https://github.com/zbrookle/sql_to_ibis) package
 (targeting [**Ibis**](https://ibis-project.org)) are analogous to
 tidyquery.
